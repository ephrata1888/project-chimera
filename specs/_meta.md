# Project Chimera — Meta Specification

## Vision

Project Chimera is an **Autonomous Influencer System** designed to convert strategic goals into controlled, traceable agent actions that generate and publish short-form social media content.

Autonomy is treated as a **governed capability**, not an unrestricted behavior.

---

## Core Principles

* Specs are the source of truth
* Every agent action must be explainable
* Safety gates override creativity
* Human oversight exists by exception, not by default

---

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

* Agents MUST NOT publish without validation
* Agents MUST NOT act outside their assigned role
* Agents MUST obey all specs in the `specs/` directory
* Human-in-the-Loop escalation is REQUIRED for low confidence or sensitive content

---

## Non-Goals

* Fully self-directed agents
* Conversational companionship systems
* Experimental social behavior without governance

---

## Success Definition

Chimera is successful when it can autonomously create and publish content **without violating constraints**, while remaining auditable and controllable at scale.
